# Background:                                                            #
# I was asked by a friend of mine to run an ANOVA to test if there was   #
# a difference between how races are treated (via arrests and citations) #
# in Falcon Heights, MN during traffic stops                             #
#                                                                        #
# Conclusions:                                                           #
# Significantly more black individuals are arrested via the binomial     #
# test, whereas there is no significant evidence that this is the case   #
# for citations                                                          #
